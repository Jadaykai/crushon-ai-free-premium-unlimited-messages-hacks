# Crushon AI Free premium unlocked MOD unlimited coins and messages HACKS

Crushon AI Free premium unlocked MOD unlimited coins and messages HACKS - The beauty of scoring multiple bomb explosions is that you can use them to clear the entire level. If your Orb accidentally detonates multiple bombs, Peglin will drop the number of bombs you have detonated, all of which will cause 50 damage points. Imagine detonating 4 bombs in a single shooting, with no more enemies waiting to appear in the background, dealing a total of 200 damage points. After the ball finds the alley, the sprinter will first throw a bomb at the enemy and deal 50 points of damage to all enemies on the field, then throw the ball you fired to compensate for the damage caused by the ball. We don't want to sell you very durable sealing tape, but this is a big loss in Crushon AI
